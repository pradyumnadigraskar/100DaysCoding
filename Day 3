Q 3 . 48. Rotate Image

    You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

    You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.



Solution:-


class Solution(object):
    def rotate(self, matrix):


        n = len(matrix)
    
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i, n):
                matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]
    
        for i in range(n):
            left, right = 0, n - 1
            while left < right:
                matrix[i][left], matrix[i][right] = matrix[i][right], matrix[i][left]
                left += 1
                right -= 1
